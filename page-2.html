	<p>Ever since 2012, Liverpool has been my favorite team because of three players. Luis Suarez, Raheem Sterling, and Steven Gerrard. Those three guys I thought were the best trio in the premier league. Now my team is one of the top 10 teams in the world. We got Mohammed Salah who broke the record for most goals in the EPL.</p>
